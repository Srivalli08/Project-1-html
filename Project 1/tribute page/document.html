<h1 style="color:sienna"> About Abdul Kalam </h1>
<p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b style="color:sienna"><i>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, (born Oct. 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong)</b></i>., Indian president (2002–07). 
  After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs.
  He planned a program that produced a number of successful missiles,helping earn him the nickname<b><i> “Missile Man</b></i>.” Beginning in the early 1990s, 
  he also served as scientific adviser to the government, and his prominent role in India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero. 
  In 2002 the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) National Democratic Alliance nominated Kalam, a Muslim, to succeed outgoing President K.R. Narayanan. 
  Kalam easily won the elections in 2002, and in the largely ceremonial post he sought to use science and technology to transform India into a developed country.
  Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. 
  Widely referred to as the <b><i>"People's President"</b></i>,[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. 
  He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
  While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] 
  Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. 
  In 2007 he was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.In his school years, 
  Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, 
  especially mathematics.[21] <b><i>After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, 
  Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College</b></i>, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] 
  He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, 
  the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. 
  Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] 
  He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
